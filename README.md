# JustCheckingInBot

Why I'm making this
- I'm friends with lots of awfully busy people, and sometimes we forget or are too tired to remember to check in on each other, so I hatched the idea for this bot
- Have I done any research as to whether a similar bot already exists? No
- I'm a baby coder, and still slowly working my way through Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code, so this is a side project to challenge myself
- I'm looking for collaborators!! :)

Bot Intro
- Welcome to JustCheckingInBot, a bot designed to help you check in regularly on your SO/friends/family. If you’re too busy, tired, fighting, or forgot to message them, JustCheckingInBot’s daily reminders will help you out. All it takes is a few seconds.

Bot features
- Custom reminders to rate your day
- If you want to talk about your day (or not), we’ll let your partner/friend know
- Let your partner/friend know you’re thinking of them with just one simple tap

To get started, head over to Settings to customise your preferences. We hope you’ll be able to connect better, conveniently and more regularly with your loved ones through this bot. :)
