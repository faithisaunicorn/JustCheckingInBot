# JustCheckingInBot

Why I'm making this
- I'm friends with lots of awfully busy people, and sometimes we forget or are too tired to remember to check in on each other, so I hatched the idea for this bot
- Have I done any research as to whether a similar bot already exists? Not very thoroughly, but idts
- I'm a baby coder, and still slowly working my way through Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code, so this is a side project to challenge myself
- I'm looking for collaborators!! :)

About
@JustCheckingInBot was designed to help you check in regularly on your SO/friends/family and remind them that someone cares. If youâ€™re too busy, tired, or forgot to message them, our daily reminders will help you out. All it takes is a few seconds.

ðŸš¦Getting Started ðŸš¦
- Create a new group with whoever you want to check in on/use this bot with
- Add @JustCheckingInBot to the group
- Youâ€™ll be individually guided through a quick set-up, then youâ€™re good to go!

Bot features
- Custom reminders to rate your day
- If you want to talk about your day (or not), weâ€™ll let your partner/friend know
- 'Thinking of you' button

Possible upcoming features (depending on my coding skill level :/)
- Individual messaging function: Youâ€™ll be able to talk to the bot directly, and the bot will message your intended person directly, without having to add the bot to a shared group
